# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-07 (development preview)

- Established the product requirements, agent instructions, architecture decisions,
  phased roadmap, and persistent handover documents.
- Selected a Windows-first Python/Qt desktop application with a separate Playwright
  browser adapter and bundled-runtime distribution strategy.
- Added a styled desktop login screen, masked in-memory credentials, responsive
  progress, cancel/disconnect, and browser cleanup on shutdown.
- Verified real smaXtec login; stable form selectors and authenticated navigation
  checks are isolated in the browser adapter. Login submits once without retries.
- Added synthetic browser and GUI tests, a hash-pinned dependency lock, Windows CI,
  and a Chromium-inclusive PyInstaller build with offline executable smoke checks.
- Built the Windows directory bundle. Local executable launch was denied by this
  computer; packaged execution verification is tracked separately from source and
  live-login success. Production installer/signing remain future release gates.
